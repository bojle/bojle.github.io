Hello, I am Shreeyash Pandey (Student, Final-Year CS Major). This page
serves as a repository for my blogs (Technical or Non-Technical), projects, and
more. My interest lies in Embedded Systems, Firmware Programming and Systems
Programming. The region (albeit fuzzy) between hardware and software is the
sweet spot for me. Being able to control and make an effect in real world is
what attracts me to it. 

I would be delighted to collaborate on any projects or research related to my
interests highlighted throughout the site.
