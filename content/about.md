## About Me

"*The life so short, the craft so long to learn*" 
— Hippocrates

Programmer, Technical Minimalist, appreciate all things creative.

I used to work at [Vicharak](https://vicharak.in) as a Systems Developer (ML Compilers) designing
an ML accelerator for the FPGA on the [Vaaman SBC](https://vicharak.in/vaaman).
I am looking for work related to ML Compilers, Traditional Compilers, or Systems in general.
Here's my [resume](resume.pdf).

Other than tech, I enjoy spontaneous plans to go out with friends and ride my [motorbike](motorbike.md)
