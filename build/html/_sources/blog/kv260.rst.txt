Impressions on the Xilinx Kria KV260
####################################

KV260 is a SoM by Xilinx that has an FPGA and a CPU on it. This is an
interesting board especially because of the the FPGA. As a result, I was
a little excited to explore it when I got my hands on it. The excitement
didn't last enough though, it soon turned into frustration and later, lament
on the state that it is in.
