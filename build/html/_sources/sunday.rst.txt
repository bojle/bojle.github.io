Paper Reading Sundays
=====================

This page serves as the repository where I document intriguing research articles primarily focused on the field of computers that capture my interest.

The intended schedule for updating this page is *every Sunday*, although there may be instances where I may not be able to maintain it consistently.

This week: `The Hardware Lottery - Sara Hooker [2020] <https://hardwarelottery.github.io/>`__

**Key Points**:

* The Hardware Lottery is when an idea succeeds because it utilizes or aligns with existing technologies or ideas. Building on existing ideas and taking advantage of compatibility provides significant leverage, which bold new ideas in computer science often lack.

* It starts with examples of Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, which promised a computer with a stored program concept and was constructed in 1871. However, true progress in achieving that goal only came a century later after World War II when the required electromagnetic technologies were invented.

* Similarly, Deep Learning was discussed in journals since the early decades of computers, but it only achieved significant breakthroughs in the past few decades.

* Machine Learning (ML) requires substantial computational resources, and the prevalent notion of "Bigger is Better" exacerbates this need. To develop new, large models, researchers require special-purpose hardware since CPUs alone are insufficient.

* Special-purpose hardware can only be built for purposes that have lasting relevance, which influences research to focus in that direction.

* Moreover, deep learning may or may not be the sole approach to achieve human-like intelligence. Exploring alternative methods will provide insights into this question, but only if those ideas succeed in the hardware lottery.
