  <h1>No-ISA is the Best ISA</h1>
<p>This week, me and my colleague were present at the first <a href="https://compilertech.org/">compilertech.org</a> workshop talking
about the work we are doing at <a href="https://vicharak.in/">Vicharak</a> involving FPGAs, Reconfigurable Computing and Compilers
for such computers. This small blog post is a brief summary of the talk.</p>
<p>The slides (and the extended slides) for the presentation are available
at:
<a href="https://github.com/vicharak-in/noisa">github.com/vicharak-in/noisa</a>.
Video for the talk will soon be available.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The talk is divided into four chapters:</p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>Chapter 1 lists the problems with modern compute, key problems being the
slowdown and end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling and the von-neumann
bottleneck. We ask ourselves whether compute should be restricted to a
small selection of available processors/architectures. Last slide in
chapter 1 lists some concrete problems where using existing compute is
difficult.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Chapters 2 and 3 include an introduction to reconfigurable/heterogeneous
computing and EDA compilers.</p>
<p>Reconfiguration and Heterogeneity are the two key ideas of the
architecture that we propose. A separation from von-neumann
architectures, by the way of flow-based reconfigurable computers is
discussed. The central theme of the idea is to make it easy/automate the
generation of <strong>hardware</strong> for our algorithms instead of <strong>programs</strong>.
In essence, the idea is to have a unique and optimal hardware for every
software.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p>Since solving problems through reconfigurable/heterogeneous require
generation of hardware, EDA compilers and their efficiency has to be
considered too. Chapter 3 is about EDA compilers being a nightmare to
deal with in terms of flexibility, hackability, performance and
adaptability.</p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p>The last chapter is on the work done so far. For this, we've designed
our own hardware
(<a href="https://docs.vicharak.in/vicharak_sbcs/vaaman/vaaman-home/">Vaaman</a>)
on which applications utilizing the Reconfigurable paradigm will be
designed. Two applications on which we are actively working are: Gati
(CNN accelerator) and Periplex (Peripheral Generator).</p>
<p>Gati is a CNN accelerator that can generate custom (optimal) accelerator
hardware for every NN model.</p>
<p>Periplex provides easy generation and multiplexing of peripheral (UART,
I2C, CAN, SPI etc.) along with linux device drivers for accessing them
through POSIX APIs.</p>
